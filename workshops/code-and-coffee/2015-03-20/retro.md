# Workshop Retro
## The Good
- People seemed interested
- Expanded some minds
- A few people discovered that there are different syntaxes than C-family

## The Bad
- Heterogeneous attendees
  - Anywhere from just started HTML to having extensive Scheme
- Several participants didn't grasp recursion before we moved on
- More advanced participants started asking deeper questions
  - Pushed me to move faster, or skip sections
- Some attendeed got stuck on the lack of argument brackets

## The Ugly
- _Waaaaaaaaaaay_ too much information for 45 minutes

## Overall Learns
1. Stick to the script
2. Explain one concept. Have them do some exercises. Repeat.
3. People expect many more keywords than Haskell has
4. People may get stuck on new syntax
5. Prodigy syndrom
   - Came easy to me, plus several years of experience
   - Not a typical experience
6. Need a guinnea pig to get feedback on how humans learn this material
