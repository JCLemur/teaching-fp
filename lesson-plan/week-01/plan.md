  - i. Graph reduction
  - ii. Evaluation Order
      - Normal Order
      - Applicative Order

## Value Proposition
- _Will_ improve your imperative code
- Expose you to new ideas, think about things differently
- Concurrency & parallelism made easy! Well, _easier_...
- Often shorter clear, clean, concise code
- The dream of Object Orientation successfully realized in a different form
  - Code reuse
  - Cleanliness

## Basic Termonology
- Side effects
- Immutability

- S-expression
  - Prefix notation
- Reduction
- Equivalence
- Identity

- Laziness
- Strictness

- Referencial Transparency
- Purity

- Lists

## Referential Tranparency
- With no side effects, calculated values can be substituted for

## Equivalence vs Reduction
`1 + 1 = 2`
- "One plus one is equal to 2"
- "One plus one reduces to two"

`2 = 1 + 1`
- "Two equals one plus one"
- **NB:** This is not reduction!

`1 + 1 = 42 - 40`
- "One plus one is equal to forty-two minus forty"
- **NB:** This is not reduction!
