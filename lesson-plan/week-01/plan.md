5. This week's problem:

## Value Proposition
- _Will_ improve your imperative code
- Expose you to new ideas, think about things differently
- Concurrency & parallelism made easy! Well, _easier_...
- Often shorter clear, clean, concise code
- The dream of Object Orientation successfully realized in a different form
  - Code reuse
  - Cleanliness

## Basic Termonology
- Side effects
- Immutability

- S-expression
  - Prefic notation
- Reduction
- Equivalence
- Identity

- Laziness
- Strictness

- Referencial Transparency
- Purity

- Lists

## Referential Tranparency
- With no side effects, calculated values can be substituted for

## Reduction

### Graph Reduction

## Evaluation Order

### Normal Order

### Applicative Order
