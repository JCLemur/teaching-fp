## Week 2
- We moved from Clojure to Racket - which was easy and feels pretty much the same.
- Getting set up for Racket was easy.
- We reviewed the homework exercises and we discussed how they could be improved - very helpful.
- We walked through lists and then implemented `map`.
  - This gave me a solid reminder of linked lists (yay).
  - We discussed the concepts as we walked through which was helpful.
  - Perhaps adding to this or having a similar problem as part of the homework would be helpful for solidifying knowledge.
- I found the Dr. Racket tutorial pretty boring :S but I can see why it was valuable.
- As part of my homework I should've reviewed the concepts from the previous time before this lesson.
