## Week 1

- Setup was simple
- Enjoyed the walkthrough of basic principles
- Glad I was able to ask questions as we went through
- Compartmentalizing the ‘definitions’/theory - and looking through these first and then discussing them as we did the applied work was great
- I was not overwhelmed with material
- For me personally, I like to know more about ‘why’ I’m learning things instead of blindly learning them - I think an intro outlining ‘why learn functional programming’ might help draw connections between what we're learning and real applications of functional programming
