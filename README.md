# Teaching Functional Programming
These are currently my working notes on how to best teach FP

I am by no means an expert in teaching this material! However, most current
materials are "okay" _at best_. There seems to be an increase in people
interested in FP, but many get scared off at the word "functor" or unfamiliar
syntax (ie: not from the C-family).

## Goal
1. Don't scare off newcomers
2. Help popularize FP by helping people teach effectively

## Strategy
- Keep it practical
- Use a flexible language ([Racket](http://racket-lang.org)) so that you don't
need to switch syntax for different concepts
- Progressive
  - Start similar to the student's background (ex. compare to Java)
- Less magic is literally demystifying
  - Reimplement common patterns to show how things work
    - `map`, `foldl`, `foldr` and `filter` from scratch
  - Compare to imperative language strategy
    - Loops vs recursion
