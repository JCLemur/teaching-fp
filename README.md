# Teaching Functional Programming
These are currently my working notes on how to best teach FP

I am by no means an expert in teaching this material! However, most current
materials are "okay" _at best_. There seems to be an increase in people
interested in FP, but many get scared off at the word "functor" or unfamiliar
syntax (ie: not from the C-family).

## Goal
1. Don't scare off newcomers
2. Help popularize FP by helping people teach effectively
